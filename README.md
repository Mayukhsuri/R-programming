Overview:

The purpose of this report is to identify business opportunities in the City of Chicago through data analysis. To find business opportunity, evaluation of two data sets were conducted; list of contracts awarded by the City of Chicago and list of contractors conducting business in the City of Chicago. These data sets were chosen because they both represented the City of Chicago contractual information. Also from a prima face, a Vendor ID was identified as primary key to join these datasets.  

The initial assumption was to conceptualize a coherence between vendors and contracts. This in theory can help derive conclusions which contractor has been awarded contacts by the City of Chicago. This was an exciting point, when connection between two different tables representing two different identities could come together and provide valuable insights for entrepreneurs. 

To achieve the goal, an understanding of the demand and supply of contacts was important.for this i first analysed Contacts Awarded. which would dipict the different types of contacts issued that represents the demand for contracts.
